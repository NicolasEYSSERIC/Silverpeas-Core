/**
 * A provider of Silverpeas services such as repositories, controllers, transactional services, and
 * so on.
 *
 * This provider is an adaptor to the underlying IoD subsystem used to manage the life-cycle
 * and the dependencies of the objects in Silverpeas. Usually, defining injection points is enough
 * for a bean to access the services in Silverpeas, but these injection points work only for beans
 * managed themselves by the IoD subsystem. Hence, this provider is for unmanaged beans in order
 * they have access all of the services available in Silverpeas.
 *
 * The provider can be either used directly by the unmanaged beans or through a more typed-specific
 * provider. This latest solution is our preferred way.
 *
 * The service provider doesn't use directly the IoD subsystem to fetch the asked service. Instead
 * it delegates the service fetching to another object, a {@code BeanContainer} instance that is
 * a wrapper of the actual IoD subsystem in use. The bind between the {@code BeanContainer}
 * interface and its implementation is performed by the Java SPI (Java Service Provider Interface).
 * Only the first available bean container implementation is loaded by the {@code ServiceProvider}
 * class.
